# CI/CD Auto-Deployment Setup

Your GitHub Actions workflow is now configured to automatically deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk on every push to `main` branch!

## Setup AWS Credentials in GitHub

### Step 1: Create AWS IAM User for Deployment

1. **Go to AWS IAM Console**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/
2. **Click "Users"** â†’ **"Create user"**
3. **User name**: `github-actions-deployer`
4. **Click "Next"**

### Step 2: Set Permissions

1. **Attach policies directly**
2. **Add these policies**:
   - `AWSElasticBeanstalkFullAccess`
   - `AmazonS3FullAccess` (for deployment artifacts)
3. **Click "Next"** â†’ **"Create user"**

### Step 3: Create Access Keys

1. **Click on the user** you just created
2. **Security credentials** tab
3. **Create access key**
4. **Use case**: Select "Application running outside AWS"
5. **Click "Next"** â†’ **"Create access key"**
6. **SAVE BOTH**:
   - âœ… Access Key ID (e.g., `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`)
   - âœ… Secret Access Key (e.g., `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`)

### Step 4: Add Secrets to GitHub

1. **Go to your GitHub repo**: https://github.com/davidjosipovic/task-pilot
2. **Settings** â†’ **Secrets and variables** â†’ **Actions**
3. **New repository secret**
4. **Add these two secrets**:

   **Secret 1:**
   - Name: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   - Value: Your access key ID from Step 3

   **Secret 2:**
   - Name: `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
   - Value: Your secret access key from Step 3

5. **Save**

## How It Works

Once you add the secrets, your workflow will:

1. âœ… Run on every push to `main` branch
2. âœ… Run all tests (backend + frontend)
3. âœ… Build Docker images
4. âœ… **Automatically deploy backend to AWS Elastic Beanstalk**
5. âœ… AWS Amplify auto-deploys frontend (already configured)

## Workflow Stages

```
Push to GitHub (main branch)
    â†“
Run Backend Tests (Jest)
    â†“
Run Frontend Tests (Vitest)
    â†“
Build Docker Images
    â†“
Deploy Backend to AWS EB âœ¨ (NEW!)
    â†“
Frontend deploys via Amplify (automatic)
    â†“
ðŸŽ‰ Both deployed!
```

## Test the Auto-Deployment

After adding the secrets, make a small change and push:

```bash
# Make a change (e.g., edit README)
echo "# Auto-deployment active!" >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Test auto-deployment"
git push

# Watch GitHub Actions tab for deployment progress
```

## Monitor Deployments

- **GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/davidjosipovic/task-pilot/actions
- **AWS EB Console**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/home?region=us-east-1
- **AWS Amplify**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?region=us-east-1

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment fails with "unauthorized"
- Check that AWS credentials are correct in GitHub Secrets
- Verify IAM user has correct permissions

### EB CLI can't find environment
- Ensure `.elasticbeanstalk/config.yml` is committed to GitHub
- Check environment name matches in workflow file

### Tests fail
- Fix the failing tests first
- Deployment only runs if all tests pass

## Security Best Practices

âœ… Never commit AWS credentials to code
âœ… Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
âœ… Use IAM user with minimal required permissions
âœ… Rotate access keys periodically
âœ… Monitor CloudWatch for suspicious activity

## Benefits

- ðŸš€ **Zero-downtime deployments**: AWS handles rolling updates
- âœ… **Automated testing**: Catches bugs before deployment
- ðŸ”„ **Continuous delivery**: Push to main = automatic deployment
- ðŸ“Š **Deployment history**: Track all deployments in GitHub Actions
- ðŸŽ¯ **Production-ready**: Professional CI/CD pipeline
